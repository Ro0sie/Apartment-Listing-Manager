# Apartment-Listing-Manager

This project implements a property-management system that organizes apartment listings using a Binary Search Tree (BST). Each apartment contains attributes such as:
1. location (string)
2. size in square feet (integer)
3. number of bedrooms (integer)
4. rent (integer)

The BST organizes apartments first by location (lexicographical order), and then by size.

This project is based on UCSB CS9 — Programming with Python
